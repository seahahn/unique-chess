## Development Workflow

### Setup Commands
```bash
task setup          # Initial project setup
task dev            # Start development servers
task clean          # Clean all dependencies
task from-scratch   # Complete reset and setup
```

### Package Scripts
```bash
pnpm format-and-lint      # Check code style
pnpm format-and-lint:fix  # Fix code style issues
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Frontend Development (SolidStart)
- Use SolidStart for application structure and routing
- Leverage SSR/CSR features for optimal performance and SEO
- Organize components for maximum reusability and modularity
- Structure code into feature-based directories

### 3D Rendering (Three.js)
- Use Three.js exclusively for 3D chessboard and piece rendering
- Place 3D assets and rendering logic in dedicated modules
- Optimize rendering performance (minimize re-renders, efficient geometries)
- Ensure accessibility for 3D elements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)

### API Communication (tRPC)
- Use tRPC exclusively for type-safe API communication
- Co-locate tRPC hooks with respective feature components
- Leverage TypeScript types from tRPC for safety and autocompletion
- Document API usage patterns in code comments

### Real-time Communication
- Use dedicated WebSocket server for real-time features
- Abstract WebSocket logic into custom hooks or stores
- Implement robust reconnection and error-handling logic

### State Management (Solid Store)
- Use Solid Store for all client-side state management
- Scope stores by feature or domain for modularity
- Avoid global singleton stores unless necessary
- Use derived stores for computed/memoized state

### Database (Prisma + Supabase)
- All database schema and migrations in `workspaces/database`
- Import Prisma client: `import { prisma } from "@unique-chess/database"`
- Use two separate Supabase projects (main data + auth data)
- Follow Prisma best practices for schema design

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer type safety over convenience
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use Zod for runtime validation with tRPC

### Code Style (Biome Configuration)
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Width**: 80 characters
- **Semicolons**: As needed
- **Quotes**: Double quotes
- **Trailing Commas**: Always
- **Bracket Spacing**: Enabled

### Best Practices
- **Simplicity**: Write simple and straightforward code
- **Readability**: Ensure code is easy to read and understand
- **Early Returns**: Use early returns to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- **DRY Principle**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable style
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand

### Function Guidelines
- Add comments describing what each function does
- Use JSDoc comments for JavaScript
- Order functions with composers appearing earlier in files
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (e.g., handleClick)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
- Place test files next to code under test (`.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`)
- Mock dependencies using Vitest utilities
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test individual functions, components, and modules

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components/modules
- Verify state management with API calls
- Use Vitest or Playwright depending on scope

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
- Place E2E tests in dedicated `/e2e/` directory
- Simulate realistic user flows
- Test authentication, gameplay, and error handling
- Use Playwright fixtures for setup/teardown

### BDD Testing (Cucumber)
- Use Cucumber.js for behavior-driven development
- Write feature files in Gherkin syntax
- Focus on user-centric scenarios

## Security & Performance

### Authentication
- Use Better Auth integrated with SolidStart
- JWT-based session management
- Support email-password and Google OAuth2
- Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies

### Security Measures
- Implement password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- CSRF/XSS protection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation with Zod
- Secure headers with helmet

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy-load media assets from MinIO
- Use signed URLs for secure asset access
- Optimize 3D rendering performance
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Internationalization & SEO

### i18n (solid-i18n)
- Organize translations in locale files (`/locales/en.json`)
- Use context providers for language switching
- Support multiple languages at runtime

### SEO Optimization
- Implement SSR meta tags for all pages
- Generate dynamic meta tags per route
- Create sitemap and robots.txt
- Validate SEO using Lighthouse

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Containerization
- Docker-based deployment for all services
- Each workspace has its own Dockerfile
- Use docker-compose for local development

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for build and deployment
- Deploy to Netlify or Fly.io (free tier preferred)
- Automated testing in CI pipeline

### Environment Management
- Use Infisical for secrets management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure credential handling

## Media & Asset Management

### MinIO Object Storage
- Store images, videos, and unstructured files
- S3-compatible API for easy integration
- Support versioning and lifecycle management
- Use presigned URLs for uploads/downloads

## Payments & Advertising

### Stripe Integration
- Handle annual/monthly memberships
- Use webhooks for payment events
- Validate all webhook requests

### Google Ads
- Show ads to non-members
- Server-side ad logic
- Privacy policy compliance

## Development Rules Migration

The following development rules have been consolidated from `.cursor/rules/`:

### Code Quality Principles
- Focus on simplicity, readability, and maintainability
- Write testable and reusable code
- Use early returns and descriptive naming
- Prefer constants over functions where possible
- Follow functional and immutable patterns

### Frontend Specific Rules
- Use SolidStart for all application structure
- Implement Three.js for 3D rendering exclusively
- Use tRPC for type-safe API communication
- Abstract WebSocket logic into custom hooks
- Ensure accessibility compliance (A11y)

### Backend Specific Rules
- Build APIs using tRPC for type safety
- Organize routers by domain (game, user, chat)
- Use Zod for input validation
- Implement robust logging and monitoring
- Design for microservice separation if needed

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests alongside new features
- Use Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain high code coverage
- Run tests automatically in CI

## Important Notes

- **Unified Architecture**: Frontend and backend are integrated in `workspaces/webapp` using SolidStart
- **No Separate Backend**: All API logic is within the SolidStart application
- **Database Workspace**: All database operations managed in `workspaces/database`
- **Monorepo Benefits**: Shared types, unified tooling, coordinated deployments
- **Modern Stack**: Emphasizes developer productivity and type safety

## Getting Started

1. **Initial Setup**: Run `task setup` to initialize the project
