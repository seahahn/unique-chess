# Cursor AI CSS & Styling Rules: 3D Chess Web Platform

These rules define the standards and best practices for all CSS and styling work on the 3D Chess Web Platform.

---

## CSS Framework

- Use **Tailwind CSS v4** for all styling[1].
- Apply utility classes for design consistency and maintainability.
- Maintain a design tokens file for theme management and standardized color, spacing, and typography values.

## Component Library

- Use **DaisyUI** components, styled with Tailwind CSS[1].
- Extend DaisyUI with custom themes as needed to match project branding.
- Ensure all components are accessible (A11y compliant) and fully responsive.

## Responsiveness

- All UI components must be fully responsive across devices.
- Use Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to adapt layouts and components.
- Test layouts on various devices and screen sizes to ensure usability.

## Customizable Skins

- Support user-customizable board and piece skins, visible to other users.
- Store skin metadata in the database for persistence and sharing.
- Fetch skin assets from **MinIO** object storage for efficient and secure delivery.

## Best Practices

- Keep rules concise and actionable.
- Split large concepts into multiple, composable rules if needed.
- Provide concrete examples or referenced files when helpful.
- Avoid vague guidance; write rules as you would for clear internal documentation.
- Regularly review and update rules to reflect evolving project standards.
